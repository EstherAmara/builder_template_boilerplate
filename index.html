						<p>Hi, I'm Nelly Agbogu aka Naija Brand Chick and also Lolo 1 of Instagram.</p>
						<p>I actually didn't start out this big in business. In fact, I started small (in my kitchen) and just like everyone else that started small there was this desire to be successful. My products were good no doubt but who cares about good products if they don't know you?</p>
						<p>With this mind, I reached out to a couple of friends to help me showcase my products  but those were closed doors. The influencers and social media manager charges were neck-breaking and did I feel depressed? YES. Did I feel left out? YES. Did I feel betrayed by the world? YES</p>
						<p>But here I am today, able to tell my story, able to lift small businesses from the ground to really high towers and this has become my life's mission: Helping Entrepreneurs.</p>
						<p>I simply decided to do things right. I said "Nelly, We Die Here Till We Succeed". I went through a series of training, put in the hard work and I can proudly call myself the Lolo 1 of Instagram because I learnt Instagram like I created the platform.</p>
						<p>With the knowledge gained, I have been able to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Earn six figures consistently</li>
							<li>Impact thousands of people around the world</li>
							<li>Host successful trade fairs</li>
							<li>Partner with big brands</li>
							<li>Get recognition and awards from different platforms</li>
							<li>and I can help you Make More Sales Using Instagram</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If that is your goal, I invite you to Dominate Instagram with my course</p>
